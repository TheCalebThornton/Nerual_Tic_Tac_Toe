# Nerual_Tic_Tac_Toe
Play against a neural network in Tic Tac Toe!


# TODO
- Create Tic Tac Toe where the user plays against AI using classical RNG movements (JS / HTML)
- Create a Tic Tac Toe AI using Quantum RNG movements (look at Austrailian Uni API)
- Design neural network to train AI based on pre-determined optimal board states (similar to chess AI).
- Design nerual netowrk to predict a user's movements after playing a few games with the user.

# Get started:
Start with the following commands:
npm i
npm start

npm start will run browserify and bundle the JS into one file.
Then http-server will start a local server (default localhost://8081).
