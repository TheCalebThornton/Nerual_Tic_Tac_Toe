# Nerual_Tic_Tac_Toe
Play against a neural network in Tic Tac Toe!


# TODO
- Design neural network to train AI based on pre-determined optimal board states (similar to chess AI).
- Design nerual netowrk to predict a user's movements after playing a few games with the user.
- Setup an interactive 'wizard' flow that allows the user to train the AI and the play against their creation.

# Get started:
Start with the following commands:  
npm i  
npm start  

npm start will run browserify and bundle the JS into one file.  
Then http-server will start a local server (default localhost://8081).
